These are class notes. I have no certification as of the time of writing this (April 21, 2020). I would like to believe that it is largely mistake-free. However, in my infinite wisdom, I may have duplicated examples between chapters. This is because the instructor often teaches by formula, by visualization, and then by example. Sometimes, a lecture will end on an example and then "we'll come back to this next time" -- I don't mind this as I attend lecture, but as a person who goes through the notes on their own time, you as the reader may be put off.

Consult your instructor before making use of my notes, as my notes are made for a specific instructor's class and his adherence to the source textbook is out of order for his own purposes. Please do not use this as a be-all-end-all source because it is an abridged version of the first half-ish of someone else's textbook.

Also: "spoz" is meant to be read as "suppose". In the interest of keeping with my instructor's lecture style, I often start hypothetical examples like this. Please bear with.

# Academic Dishonesty Disclaimer

PLEASE CONSULT YOUR INSTRUCTOR IN THE USE OF MY NOTES, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE INSTRUCTOR'S TEST QUESTIONS CAN SOMETIMES BE ANOTHER INSTRUCTOR'S EXAMPLES OR VICE-VERSA. I DISCLAIM FULL RESPONSIBILITY ON WHAT IS DONE WITH MY NOTES AND HEAVILY SUGGEST AN HONEST APPROACH TO LEARNING CALCULUS-BASED STATISTICS. THE INTENT OF THESE NOTES ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE TO HELP OTHERS LEARN AND NOT TO AID IN CHEATING. MY EXAMPLES ARE AN EFFECTIVE TRANSCRIPTION OF WHAT MY PROFESSOR TAUGHT. USE THESE AS A REFERENCE FOR THE MATERIAL, NOT AS A VARIABLE ANSWER KEY.

With that in mind, please enjoy.

# How to use

There will most likely be a "main.pdf" file in the directory eventually -- that is the final copy of all notes to date. Open with a PDF reader or functional equivalent. Please consult the table of contents for information on which item is which.

If there is not, however, then you should read each of them in order by lecture number. Lectures 002-006 are missing because I compiled them into Lecture 001, as the amount of material in 001-006 was not enough to constitute an entire chapter, in my opinion.
