These are class notes made by a college student who has no certification in any way, shape, or form as of the time of initialization of the repo (Nov. 3, 2019). They were made to learn LaTeX and to become better at general communication by singling out main ideas into something that I can reference and look at later in the future when I might not remember the material quite as well as I did at the time that I was in the class.

# Disclaimer

Consult your instructor before making use of my notes, as my notes are made for a specific instructor's class, and his adherence to the source textbook is out of order for his own purposes. Please do not use this as a be-all-end-all source because it is an abridged version of the first half-ish of someone else's textbook. With that in mind, please enjoy.

# How to use

There will most likely be a "main.pdf" file in the directory -- that is the final copy of all notes to date. Open with a PDF reader or functional equivalent. Please consult the table of contents for information on which item is which.
