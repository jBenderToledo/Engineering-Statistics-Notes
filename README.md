These are lecture notes taken for Engineering Statistics, a course at Lorain County Community College. My name is Jonathan Bender. If you have issue with me putting these notes online, please contact me by any means necessary and I can make this private. These are used as a means for me to learn and showcase what I've done using LaTeX and NOT as a means for others to use GitHub to pirate textbooks. Please keep this in mind.

# Disclaimer

Your notes and your education are your responsibility. Please do not use my notes to cheat on exams or whatever, as much as I doubt that you *would*. So:

* Consult your instructor for their help beforehand -- after that, then, I would suggest to make use of my notes (or any means necessary, really).
* What the instructor covers and the order by which they choose to cover the material are completely different from the source textbook.
* Any factual inaccuracies are moreso my responsibility at the time that I receive test scores than they are my responsibility at the time that *you* receive *yours.* Please keep this in mind.

Either way, please use this as either a LaTeX reference or a cliffnotes reference -- please do NOT use it as a be-all-end-all source.
