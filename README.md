These are class notes made by a college student who has no certification in any way, shape, or form as of the time of initialization of the repo (Nov. 3, 2019). They were made moreso to learn LaTeX than they were to be an informative font of knowledge and the spotty quality inside reflects as much.

# Disclaimer

Consult your instructor before making use of my notes, as my notes are made for a specific instructor's class, and his adherence to the source textbook is out of order for his own purposes. Please do not use this as a be-all-end-all source because it is an abridged version of the first half-ish of someone else's textbook. With that in mind, please enjoy.
