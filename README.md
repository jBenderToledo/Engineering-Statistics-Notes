These are class notes. I have no certification as of the time of writing this (April 21, 2020). I would like to believe that it is largely mistake-free. However, in my infinite wisdom, I may have duplicated examples between chapters. This is because the instructor often teaches by formula, by visualization, and then by example. Sometimes, a lecture will end on an example and then "we'll come back to this next time" -- I don't mind this as I attend lecture, but as a person who goes through the notes on their own time, you as the reader may be put off.

# Disclaimer

Consult your instructor before making use of my notes, as my notes are made for a specific instructor's class and his adherence to the source textbook is out of order for his own purposes. Please do not use this as a be-all-end-all source because it is an abridged version of the first half-ish of someone else's textbook.

# Academic Dishonesty Disclaimer

I do not know any instructor's particular stance on whether or not the use of these notes would be cheating and, for the foreseeable and unforeseeable future, disclaim responsibility regarding the way my notes are used here and now. **Please consult your instructor on the use of my notes, especially if their take-home exams happen to recycle questions that were used as examples in this repo.** With that in mind, please enjoy.

# How to use

There will most likely be a "main.pdf" file in the directory eventually -- that is the final copy of all notes to date. Open with a PDF reader or functional equivalent. Please consult the table of contents for information on which item is which.

If there is not, however, then you should read each of them in order by lecture number.
